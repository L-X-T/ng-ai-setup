# NG AI Setup

A practical Angular workspace starter with modern best practices, AI-ready tooling, and scalable project setup guidance.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.0.0 on June 6th, 2026.

## Generate a new project with the CLI

To start we've created a new Angular project using the `ng new` command:

```shell
ng new ng-ai-setup
```

This sets up the basic structure of your Angular application, including configuration files, dependencies, and a simple starter component. It also initializes a Git repository for version control.

### fix initial commit

We fixed the initial commit by removing unnecessary duplications of the `AGENTS.md` instructions und running the following command:

```
pnpm format
```

which then executes:

```aiignore
prettier --write .
```

To avoid doing this manually every time, we can set up a pre-commit hook using Husky to automatically run the formatter before each commit.

## Install & setup Husky

### Install Husky

```shell
pnpm add -D husky
```

### Initialize Husky

```shell
pnpm exec husky init
```

### Update .husky/pre-commit

```shell
pnpm format
```

## Install Angular ESLint

To ensure code quality and consistency, we install Angular ESLint in our project. This tool helps us identify and fix issues in our TypeScript code according to best practices.

```shell
ng add @angular-eslint/schematics
```

This way, we can maintain code quality without having to remember to run the command manually.

### Lint-staged

We configured Angular ESLint to run as part of our development workflow, ensuring that any new code adheres to our coding standards before it's committed to the repository.

```shell
pnpm add -D lint-staged
```

In our `package.json`, we added the following configuration to run ESLint on staged files:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{html,js,ts}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{css,json,md,scss}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

We updated our Husky pre-commit hook to run lint-staged:

```shell
pnpm lint-staged
```

### Extend ESLint configuration

By adding some more rules to our ESLint configuration, we can enforce better coding practices and catch potential issues early on. We can extend the default Angular ESLint configuration by creating a `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of our project with the following content:

Just look at the `eslint.config.js` to see my recommendations.

To apply the new ESLint rules, we can run the following command:

```shell
ng lint --fix
```

There are two remaining issues that we need to fix manually:

```text
/Users/lxt/ng/ng-ai-setup/src/app/app.ts
  4:1  warning  The component's `changeDetection` value should be set to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`  @angular-eslint/prefer-on-push-component-change-detection

/Users/lxt/ng/ng-ai-setup/src/main.server.ts
  5:47  error  Missing return type on function  @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type
```

Since we're lazy, we can of course use `codex` or other tools to fix these issues for us.

## Angular Coding Style Guide

Find our [Angular Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/L-X-T/ng-ai-setup/blob/main/style-guide/style-guide.md) in the `style-guide` folder.

It contains general guidelines for writing clean and maintainable code in Angular projects, as well as specific style guides for different file types such as Git commits, HTML templates, NPM packages, SCSS styling files, and TypeScript files.
